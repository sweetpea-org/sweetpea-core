Tests
=====

This directory contains the haskell unit test launcher (`Spec.hs`), as well as a few bash scripts for integration tests. While all the tests in `Spec.hs` are passing, none of the bash scripts seem to work in their current state. They may or may not be useful in the future.

All testing scripts *must* be run from the test directory.
