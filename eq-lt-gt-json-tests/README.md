Equality/Inequality Tests
=========================

None of these tests are automated at the moment. To run these tests, first build and start the server according to the instructions in the parent README.

Then from this directory, run the `run-test.sh` script against one of the files in this directory:

```
./run-tests.sh eq-0-fail.json
```

It will print the output of the solver, followed by the json spec so you can check the assignments to [1, 2, 3] match the spec.
